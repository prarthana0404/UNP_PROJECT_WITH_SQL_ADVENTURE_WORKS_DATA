# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_SQL_ADVENTURE_WORKS_DATA


As part of my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP), I undertook a comprehensive SQL project using the Adventure Works database to gain hands-on experience in data analysis and business intelligence. The project involved restoring and managing the database in SQL Server, followed by writing structured queries to extract and analyze key business metrics. I explored various aspects such as total revenue, profit margins, sales trends, territory-wise and product-wise performance, and customer behavior. Through this project, I enhanced my proficiency in SQL by applying joins, aggregations, and filtering techniques to generate actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making.
